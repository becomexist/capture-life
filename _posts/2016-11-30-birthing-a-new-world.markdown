My Dad used to say to me that at the core of every human, there lies nothing more than a self interested, self maximising, greedy beast. He believed that this is the insurmountable inner mountain, firmed in the landscape of our DNA from a time when our primal lives were ‘nasty, brutish and short’, that is the Vesuvian font of all of the suffering in the world. An immobilising and hope-sapping story indeed.

This logical trail is traversed commonly in the modern world, and has wound its way around, to a greater or lesser extent, the collective unconscious of Western culture. The ideas seeded by Darwin and Descartes of a competitive, individualist race for survival, have rooted into every aspect of our society; from familial relationships to politics, food production and commerce. However this story of ‘Human Nature’ runs counter to the ideas of the emergent vision of a connected world of, to use Charles Eisenstein’s term, ‘Interbeings’. In this world it is love, trust, respect and community that are at once the indispensible fuel, vehicle, journey and destination of a benevolent all inclusive life. Eisenstein talks of how our current separating narrative is not human nature at all, but rather the denial of it; that is, our fundamental need for connection and intimacy.

Ibu Robin Lim, the founder of the natural birthing and healthcare centre Yayasan Bumi Sehat, and resolute carrier of this emergent vision, asserts that, ‘Research points to the fact that being born without trauma is the foundation for having an intact capacity to love and trust.’ 

Dr Gabor Maté echoes this with his research into ‘implicit memory’. Different to explicit memory, the recollection of experiences and information, implicit memory is formed preverbally and is stored as nerve circuits ready to fire without any specific recall of the origins of the memory. It is experienced as a bodily reaction rather than that of coherent thought.

It is this implicit memory which forms the conditions for either a safe, holistic platform upon which a child’s personality can be built, or a traumatised, fragmented one. This can happen in utero, during birth and postnatally.
Maté says that, ‘Being cut off from our own natural self-compassion is one of the greatest impairments we can suffer. Along with our ability to feel our own pain go our best hopes for healing, dignity and love.’

This is the essence of the work of Bumi Sehat in providing free, safe, gentle and natural natal care to people in Bali who otherwise couldn’t afford it. By creating a calm, nurturing environment for the labouring mother, her body and mind are able to surrender to the process of giving birth, guided by the release of chemicals in the brain such as dopamine and oxytocin, which both regulate the delivery and enable the mother to be with the pain.  

A calm mother, connected with her body, reduces the possibility of a traumatic birth, delivering a baby into the world in a way that sparks his or her life off with the uninterrupted capacity for empathy and connectedness. 

It is of course not always this straight forward. In preparing for the birth of our baby boy, Solomon, my partner, Emily, and I chose a midwife led home waterbirth supported by a Doula. We kitted out the living room with warm, gentle lighting, supportive gifts from all of our friends, calming scents and music. Everything was set for the most harmonious of labours, but due to some complications that emerged towards the end, we had to do the actual delivery in hospital. 

However, even if we could have known this would have happened we wouldn’t have gone about anything differently. The home birth, especially the part in the water, was, although challenging, an incredibly beautiful experience. It has led on to us being open to exploring alternative parenting approaches, with the intention of forming an alternative, more nurturing container for our child to carry with him a sense of connection and centredness, apparently uncommon in the Western world.   

The experience also showed us quite clearly that the Western medical approach can work symbiotically with the older, more traditional practices. These older ways are very effective in creating a nurturing environment for the parents and baby before, during and after the birth, and are ideal for the majority of births. The medical approach of course is essential when life threatening complications occur. There is much to be gained from these two approaches being used in unison.   

The late, great David Fleming observed that culture and trust in society have been replaced by financial transactions, and have become ‘decorative rather than structural’. Fleming predicted that our economy as we know it will crash, and it will be replaced by culture, community and gifts. 

For this to happen it would indeed require a transformation at the core level of the story with which we relate to the world. It therefore makes sense that we would begin at the beginning – at the point when we first emerge; the point at which, like a spark in tinder, we need more care, subtlety and tenderness than at any other time in our lives. 

If we desire a gentle, caring and nurturing society, one in which there is space for the indiscriminate safety and sense of belonging for all beings, we must consciously craft from birth the conditions that will make these values an inner reality, for them, in turn, to be expressed into the world as actions.  

Reading this you may well have your ‘hapless idealist’ alarm triggered.  I will preempt this by saying what I used to say to my Dad when he accused me of being an idealist - that when envisioning a new possibility for the world, why would we envision anything other than what would be ideal? Realism is all too often resignation in fancy dress. 

I will leave you with the powerfully simple words of Ibu Robin Lim which, for me, emblemise the driving force behind her work with Yayasan Bumi Sehat, ‘I imagine a world in which all humans are born with an intact capacity to love, and I am willing to devote my life to making it happen.’
