1. Reduce the pain of contractions.

Since we believe that epidurals have a negative effect on the health of both mother and a baby, a natural way of coping with pain is a bath full of warm water. When you have aches and pains, do you not just want to soak in a warm bath? The water has the same effect on the pains of contractions.

2. Reduced risk of episiotomy and tearing.

Episiotomies are becoming more and more routine in birth. Mothers to believe that the increase in routine episiotomies is a direct result of the rise in epidurals. An epidural leaves the woman unable to feel her baby coming down through the birth canal thus limiting her ability to control the pace at which the baby emerges. By giving birth in water, not only do they still have control over the body, the water also softens the perineum reducing the risk of tearing.

3. Choose any position you want.

In the water, You are still able to get into any position you desire for birthing. The natural birth position is the squat. However, because of our way of life, many of us are not able to squat for long periods of time. Being in water makes it easier for you to hold this position for much longer periods of time if you choose.

4. Increased ability to relax.

One of the keys to a successful natural birth is the woman’s ability to relax completely and give into each contraction. Tensing during a contraction will only make it hurt worse and can slow down labor.

5. The gentle transition for a baby.

A little one has been floating in warm water for nine months. Moving from the birth canal to cold air is probably a bit shocking! This option gives a baby a smoother transition allowing to slowly bring a baby into our environment. Additionally, it slows the cutting of the cord too soon allowing a baby’s to transition from receiving the oxygen from a mother to breathing on their own.
