*I met Mesi and Brad in 2012 during the retreat in the Buddhist monastery, Nepal. Then few year later they moved to Bali, where I lived at the moment. This beautiful conscious family chose home birth with Bumi Sehat, natural birth centre in Bali, for their first child and had an amazing experience. After this experience, Mesi felt the calling to join the group of woman to become a doula herself.*

By the time the midwives and doula arrived, I was already 8.5 cm dilated. I wondered if this expansion happened in the last hour, since I started having contractions, or slowly over the previous few days. I had been feeling “birthy” for 48 hours, somehow floating between the two states of pregnancy and motherhood.

Robin examined me on the bed, incidentally, the first time I was checked by them throughout the whole pregnancy. I was naked and I felt powerful like a birthing goddess. She suggested that, if I wanted my baby to pop into the world through water, I had better get into the pool that my hubby had filled up since my water broke.

I was there between super intense sensations not so gracefully screaming and panting, sometimes filled with panic, and these angels just set next to the pool holding space, smiling and empowering me with every word, every touch and look. There was this point where it sank in that there was no going back. It needed to happen. I looked at them and midwives gently suggested that now was the time to push. I was stunned, I thought I had been pushing for the last two hours or so!

So my husband stood behind me, I got into a squat and I bore down on his arms. We were so strong together. These amazing women started chanting the Gayatri mantra to welcome her soul into this earthly plane. She shot into the water with a momentum that she still has, and Robin so skilfully caught her and put her on my chest. She opened her little almond eyes, looked up right into mine. The most precious moment of my life.

We went to the bed and started nursing, had a celebratory glass of wine, some food while the support team cleaned up. They left two hours after birth. It was us. Our brand new family in our tropical home snuggling. From my water breaking to just the three of us lying on the bed in our new wholeness, everything took six hours.We left the placenta on to allow her to receive the blood and nutrients completely, then burned it off in a mini ceremony the next day.

We are blessed to have such a beautiful start for our daughter in this life and thank the lovely people at Bumi Sehat for allowing us to have this special experience.
