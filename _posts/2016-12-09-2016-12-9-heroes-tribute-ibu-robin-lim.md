Ibu Robin Lim is an extraordinary woman doing extraordinary things for families. In 2011, she was nominated for CNN Hero Awards, together with another nine nominees showing the example of selfless services for the amazing work she does around the world. Now after 5 years CNN Heroes, has filmed again at Bumi Sehat to catch up with Ibu Robin and others doing phenomenal work to reduce suffering. 

As Robin stated upon accepting her award, "every baby's first breath on Earth could be one of peace and love. Every mother should be healthy and strong. Every birth could be safe and loving. But our world is not there yet."
